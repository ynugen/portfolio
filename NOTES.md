## Setting up the Repository
My project will be created using a Next.js frontend and a Springboot backend. Because I set both folders in the same repository, I realise that it would be super helpful for me to have a docker-compose file that configures and runs both servers with a single command. I'm using the docker website, other github repo examples, and chatGPT to help me understand what the heck I am writing.

Dockerfiles are to define then environment of a single container wherease the docker-compose.yml defines how those environments interact with each other. To be able to successfully run these files. I will need to write an API for the frontend to be able to pull from the backend. Alas, that might be tomorrow or another day.
