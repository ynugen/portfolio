# My Portfolio Website

## Description

I want to create a website to display my portfolio in a creative and fun way. I want to be able to create blog posts, display my art and coding project, and perhaps allow people to subscribe to a weekly newsletter. I will be using Figma to design the pages and flow. I'm going to implement the front end using the React framework Next.js and learn Spring Boot for the backend.
